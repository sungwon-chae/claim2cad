# Claim2CAD — Progress Log

A timestamped, phase-by-phase log of what was done, what was verified, and what
was deferred. Times are local (Asia/Seoul, KST).

## Phase 1 — Reconnaissance — STARTED 2026-04-27 00:45 KST

### Setup
- Initial `git clone https://github.com/earthtojake/text-to-cad` aborted with
  `HTTP/2 stream cancel` mid-fetch. Re-cloned with HTTP/1.1 + larger
  `http.postBuffer` and `--depth=1`; succeeded.
- Per the user's clarification, the upstream `text-to-cad/` checkout is held
  read-only as a *reference*. Claim2CAD lives in a sibling directory with its
  own git history, viewer, and CAD pipeline. We do **not** vendor text-to-cad's
  skill scripts — instead we use `build123d` directly (see `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`
  entry "Why we don't depend on the upstream skill scripts").
- Branch `claim2cad-mvp` initialized at the empty repo root.

### Reconnaissance findings (full notes in `docs/ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md`)
- Read `skills/cad/SKILL.md`, `skills/cad/references/generator-contract.md`,
  `skills/cad/references/gen-step-part.md`, `skills/cad/references/gen-step-assembly.md`,
  `skills/cad/scripts/gen_step_part/cli.py`, `skills/cad/scripts/common/generation.py`
  (first 100 lines), `skills/cad/scripts/common/glb.py`, the assembly contract
  inside `generator-contract.md` lines 44–74, and a generator fixture at
  `skills/cad/scripts/common/tests/test_generation.py:120-170`.
- Read viewer code at `viewer/lib/cadDirectoryScanner.mjs:1-100`,
  `viewer/lib/render/glbMeshData.js:1-232` (the GLB → mesh-parts pipeline that
  reads `mesh.name || mesh.parent.name`), and `viewer/components/CadViewer.js:1-80`.
- Read `viewer/package.json` — Vite 7 + React 18 + three 0.160; viewer port 4178.

### Verification (Phase 1 acceptance criteria)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md` exists, ≥300 lines, ≥5 file:line references.
- We did NOT run upstream `npm run dev` — the user explicitly asked us not to
  modify `text-to-cad/` and we have no need to. A standalone Vite viewer in
  `Claim2CAD/viewer/` is built from scratch in Phase 5.
